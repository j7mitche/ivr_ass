methods:
    background removal, tresholding 
    detecting obstacles and dots, compactness and size
    projection
   
    visual servoing, trajectory correction
    subgoals

    code structure, some implementation details


make evaluation
    1: maze with overlayed trajectory of a robot
    +2: show how good we are at detecting corners of the maze
    +3: ---- || ---- regions where obstacles are placed and location of a robot

    4: statistics with number of failures, how far away from final target we've stopped

    +5: accuracy of choosing a correct path
    +6: observed trajectory correcting
